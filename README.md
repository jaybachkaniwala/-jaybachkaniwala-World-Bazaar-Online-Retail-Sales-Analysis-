Key Metrics (will be refined later)
1. Sales Trends and Revenue Optimization
Metrics:
	• Total Sales (Revenue): Total amount of sales for a specific period.
		○ Formula: Sum(total_amount)
		○ Visualization: Line chart (sales over time), KPI cards (total sales by month/quarter)
	• Sales by Product Category: Contribution of each product category to total revenue.
		○ Formula: Sum(total_amount) grouped by product_category
		○ Visualization: Bar chart, Pie chart
	• Top 10 Products by Revenue and Quantity Sold: Identify which products are driving the most revenue and which are most frequently purchased.
		○ Formula: Top 10 products by total_amount and quantity
		○ Visualization: Bar chart or Table
	• Revenue Growth Rate: Percentage change in revenue over time to identify growth patterns.
		○ Formula: ((Current period revenue - Previous period revenue) / Previous period revenue) * 100
		○ Visualization: Line chart or KPI card
		
2. Customer Behavior and Retention
Metrics:
	• Customer Lifetime Value (CLV): Total revenue generated by a customer over time, used to identify high-value customers.
		○ Formula: Sum(total_amount) grouped by customer_id
		○ Visualization: Bar chart, Line chart (trends of CLV over time)
	• Average Order Value (AOV): Average transaction size, providing insight into customer spending behavior.
		○ Formula: Sum(total_amount) / Count of transactions
		○ Visualization: KPI card or Line chart (AOV over time)
	• New vs. Returning Customers: Percentage and trend of new vs. repeat customers to assess customer loyalty and acquisition.
		○ Formula: Count distinct customer_id for new customers and count of customer_id where multiple transactions exist for repeat customers
		○ Visualization: Donut chart (new vs. returning), Line chart (trend over time)
	• Sales by Customer Demographics (Age, Gender, Location): Break down sales by age group, gender, and region to identify high-value segments.
		○ Formula: Sum(total_amount) grouped by customer_age, customer_gender, and customer_location
		○ Visualization: Bar chart, Pie chart, Geographic map
		
3. Discount and Promotion Effectiveness
Metrics:
	• Revenue from Discounted vs. Non-Discounted Sales: Analyze the impact of discounts on total sales.
		○ Formula: Sum(total_amount) where discount > 0 and where discount = 0
		○ Visualization: Bar chart (side-by-side comparison)
	• Discount Utilization Rate: Percentage of transactions where a discount was applied.
		○ Formula: Count of transactions where discount > 0 / Total count of transactions
		○ Visualization: KPI card or Donut chart
	• Discount Impact on Quantity Sold: Correlate discounts with the volume of products sold to understand the effectiveness of promotions.
		○ Formula: Group by discount and sum quantity sold
		○ Visualization: Line chart or Scatter plot (showing discount vs. quantity)
	• Conversion Rate by Discounted vs. Non-Discounted Sales: Compare the proportion of customers who complete purchases with and without discounts.
		○ Formula: Number of completed transactions / Number of initiated transactions
		○ Visualization: Bar chart or KPI card
		
4. Customer Segmentation for Targeted Marketing
Metrics:
	• Customer Segments by Age and Gender: Identify which customer segments are most responsive to promotions and product offerings.
		○ Formula: Sum(total_amount) grouped by customer_age and customer_gender
